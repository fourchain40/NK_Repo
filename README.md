Welcome to my project repository! This collection highlights a variety of projects showcasing my experience in software engineering, data science, and algorithmic problem-solving.

## Recent Projects

### 1. [Predicting Coronary Heart Disease (CHD)](https://github.com/thaonguyyen/project_chd)
**Purpose:** This project explored different machine learning models, including linear regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and decision trees, to predict the likelihood of coronary heart disease (CHD). The goal was to investigate socio-economic factors, such as education, in relation to heart disease risk. Our research was aimed at an academic audience, such as professors and peers in the machine learning field, and conveyed the message that machine learning can predict health outcomes.

### 2. [Predicting the Outcome of the 2024 Presidential Election in Virginia](https://github.com/gaboojie/project_voting)
**Purpose:** This project used machine learning to forecast voting outcomes at the county level in Virginia, leveraging historical voting and demographic data. It provided insights into voting trends, voter turnout, and party distribution across counties, showing how data-driven approaches can be applied to political science and election forecasting.

### 3. [Presidential Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/bwillow1222/ds4002MI3P1)
**Purpose:** This project involved analyzing the sentiment in speeches from the 2024 U.S. presidential race, including a debate, Donald Trump's rally speech in Wisconsin, and Kamala Harris's rally speech in Philadelphia. Using Python algorithms, we processed and classified rhetoric by sentiment, with the goal of exploring political messaging and how sentiment plays a role in influencing voter perception.

### 4. [Sports Viewership Analysis Post-COVID](https://github.com/bwillow1222/ds4002MI3P2)
**Purpose:** This project analyzed how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted viewership trends across major American sports leagues, specifically the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL. Using double exponential smoothing, we forecasted viewership for each league and compared it with actual data to assess recovery patterns. The goal was to determine whether viewership has returned to pre-pandemic levels, providing insights for sports analysts, broadcasters, and league stakeholders into how audience engagement in professional sports has shifted post-COVID.

### 5. [Pet Breed Classification](https://github.com/bwillow1222/ds4002MI3P3)
**Purpose:** This project focused on developing a machine learning-powered tool to classify cat and dog breeds from images, aimed at assisting adoption centers. Using the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, the team trained a pre-trained convolutional neural network (ResNet50) to accurately classify 37 breeds of cats and dogs. The approach included transfer learning, data augmentation, and iterative model refinement. The goal was to create a robust, generalizable model that could support adoption centers in identifying pet breeds, which plays a role in matching pets with prospective adopters.

## Other Projects

## Cell Segmentation
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a Python-based cell segmentation program utilizing the Mahotas library. The system achieved a 75% precision rate in accurately extracting nucleus coordinates in cellular interactions. Advanced Gaussian filtering and labeling techniques were incorporated, significantly enhancing the segmentation process's accuracy and reliability.

## Cardiac Regeneration Model
In this project, an Agent-Based Model of Cardiac Regeneration after Myocardial Infarction was co-developed using NetLogo. The model contributes to ongoing research in Myocardial Infarction treatment, reflecting a deep understanding of complex medical concepts and the application of advanced modeling techniques to simulate cardiac regeneration processes.


## Course Review
This project involved the development of a comprehensive course review system using JavaFX. Contributions spanned the presentation, business logic, and data layers, creating a user-friendly interface and smooth system functionality. SQL was utilized for efficient data manipulation, while Git version control and code review processes facilitated collaboration and maintained codebase integrity throughout the project lifecycle.

## Implementation and Application of Graph and other Algorithms
This project explores fundamental graph theory concepts and algorithmic problem-solving. It includes the implementation of graph data structures using adjacency matrices and adjacency lists, as well as key algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Topological Sort, Dijkstra’s, Prim’s, Kruskal’s, and Max-Flow. Additionally, various problems provided by a professor were solved using Greedy, Dynamic Programming, and Divide and Conquer algorithms.

## Visualizing LEGO Data
This project features the development of an interactive Shiny App in R to visualize trends in LEGO set sales. Leveraging ggplot2, plotly, and ggwordcloud packages, the app provides dynamic features such as theme-based word clouds, breakdowns by theme, and manufacturing brush plots for enhanced user interaction. The LEGO dataset was meticulously cleaned and preprocessed to address missing values and transform variables, ensuring effective analysis and a smooth user experience.
